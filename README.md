# Rotten Tomatoes Movie Rating Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict Rotten Tomatoes scores for movies using machine learning models like LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.

## Installation
Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install lightgbm xgboost catboost optuna
```

## Running the Project
Run the Jupyter Notebook file:

```bash
jupyter notebook Monisha_R_rotten_tomato_movie_prediction_.ipynb
```

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading**: Load and clean dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Use LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
- **Optimization**: Tune models using Optuna.
- **Evaluation**: Compare models based on RÂ², RMSE, MAE.

## Results
The notebook evaluates and compares model performance. The best model is highlighted based on test scores.
